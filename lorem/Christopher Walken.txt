<p>I thought about you every time I jerked off, dickhead. I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you, with a minimum of fuss! Money, jewels, a *very* big ball of string. Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse. I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell. He hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then, when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. Did you hear about the happy Roman? He was "glad he ate her." Selina! Selina Kyle, you're fired! And Bruce Wayne, why are you dressed up like Batman? You got the wrong guy, ace! You're talking to me all wrong... It's the wrong tone. You do it again and I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron. Hey, tell me, does your mother sew? BOOM. Get her to sew that! I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell. I'm neglecting my other guests. Enjoy yourself, you'll find the young ladies stimulating company. This is America, babe, you gotta think big to be big.</p>
